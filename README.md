<h3>About</h3>
This project explores the classic game “Tic Tac Toe” (Noughts and Crosses) but with a twist—introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into the gameplay. The project focuses on key questions like, “How will the AI be implemented?” and “What happens when a human plays against AI?” The aim is to discover how AI evolves and potentially outperforms human players over time.

I chose this project to dive into a new, fascinating field—AI—which is becoming increasingly influential across industries, from medicine to autonomous driving. Through research and expert consultations, I’m developing this AI-enhanced version of Tic Tac Toe while gaining valuable insights into AI development and problem-solving. The outcome will demonstrate how AI influences a traditionally simple game and what the future holds for human-AI interactions.

<b>P.S.</b> All the infromation about the features and development of the project can be found in the document called "Documentation" with illustrations

<h3>Main Features</h3>

1. <b>Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation</b>
	•	Core Feature: Q-learning algorithm is used to train the computer to play Tic Tac Toe by rewarding the AI for making successful moves and punishing poor decisions.
	•	Q-Table: A matrix storing the learned state-action values, updated as the computer plays games and learns optimal strategies.

2. **Training and Learning Progress Visualisation**
	•	Graphs and Charts: The AI’s progress over time is illustrated with graphs showing key metrics.

3. **Simulation of Human vs AI and AI vs AI**
	•	Gameplay Simulation: Allow for human vs AI and AI vs AI games to showcase how the AI applies its learned strategies.

4. **Analytical Insights**
	•	Game Outcomes Analysis: Provide detailed analysis of each game, including:
	•	Moves made by both the human and AI players.
	•	Performance Metrics
